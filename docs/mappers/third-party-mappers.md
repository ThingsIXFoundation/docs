# Third-Party-Mappers

To allow the ThingsIX network to grow, the ThingsIX Foundation has launched the Third-Party-Mapper program ([more info here](../developer-documentation/third-party-mapper-program.md)). The manufacturers and models below have been approved. 

**At the moment no third-party-mappers are approved**

:::caution Disclaimer
The ThingsIX Foundation will review the mapper design but is not able to verify the credibility of a manufacturer. Do your own research before ordering a mapper and always use the links below.
