# Getting Started

ThingsIX is a world-wide LoRaWAN network that supports (almost) any existing LoRaWAN gateway. To see which gateways are validated by the community to be compatible see: [Compatible Gateways](./gateway-compatibility/overview.md).

To get started connecting LoRaWAN Gateways to ThingsIX, first make sure to setup a wallet: [Connecting Wallet](./connecting-wallet.md)

Next follow the instructions found for your gateway or see the generic instructions on how to setup a ThingsIX Forwarder: [Setting up VPS](./setting-up-vps.md) and [Installing Forwarder](./installing-forwarder.md).
