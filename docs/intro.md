# Introduction

ThingsIX is a decentralized global Internet of Things network, built to reward gateway operators for providing reliable coverage and for delivering reliable data to end users by using blockchain technology.

ThingsIX introduces unique trusted mapping hardware to give a new dimension to network coverage and validation. Any existing or new LoRaÂ®-gateway will be able to join the ThingsIX network.

# Whitepaper
To read about the idea behind ThingsIX and the overall architecture please read the [whitepaper](ThingsIX/whitepaper.md). 

# Getting started
Once the test network and later the main network launch, we will add tutorials to onboard gateways, mappers and things (end-devices).
