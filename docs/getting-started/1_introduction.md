# Introduction
In this section we will explain how to configure and onboard your LoRaÂ® gateway
onto the ThingsIX network. We will do this using [Chirpstack](https://www.chirpstack.io)
together with ThingsIX specific components. The Chirpstack project provides all
required components to setup a LoRaWAN network. The ThingsIX components ensure
that packets are routed to their destination and gateway owners are compensated
for their service.

You will need to have the ability to install, configure and run custom software
on your gateway. And you will require some Polygon `MATIC` and `THIX` tokens
to onboard and attest gateway details in the ThingsIX gateway registry.
