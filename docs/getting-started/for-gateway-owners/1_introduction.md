# Introduction
In this guide we will explain how to configure and on-board your LoRaÂ® gateways
onto the ThingsIX network. ThingsIX starts as a data-only network. That means
there is no support for tokens and no rewards. As a result gateways don't have 
to be on-boarded and can freely join ThingsIX. Once token support is added you 
will need to on-board your gateways, set their details and owner to participate
and earn rewards.
