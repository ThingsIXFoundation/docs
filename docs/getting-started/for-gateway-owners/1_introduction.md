# Introduction
In this guide we will explain how to configure and connect your LoRaÂ® gateways
onto the ThingsIX network. ThingsIX is launched as a data-only network and will
add token support later (planned 2023 Q2). That means there is initially no 
reward system. As a result gateways don't have to be on-boarded and can freely 
join ThingsIX. Once token support is added you will need to on-board your 
gateways to set their details and owner to participate and earn rewards.
